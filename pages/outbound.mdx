## API-Driven Outbound Activities

NLPearl.AI's API provides a powerful interface for developers to create and manage outbound call activities directly through code, offering complete control over the implementation and execution of these interactions.

### Overview of API-Driven Outbound Activities

Unlike platform-managed campaigns, API-driven activities allow for direct integration into your existing systems and workflows. This setup enables a more dynamic application of outbound call logic tailored to specific business needs, where calls can be triggered based on custom criteria defined within your application.

### Setting Up API Outbound Activities

1. **Obtain an API Key**: Secure an API key from NLPearl.AI to authenticate and interact with our outbound call API.

2. **Create an Outbound Activity**: Use the API to define and initiate an outbound activity, setting parameters such as call logic, timing, and handling instructions programmatically.

3. **Manage Leads Programmatically**: Integrate your existing lead management systems directly with the outbound activity. There is no need to upload leads to the platform; instead, use your databases to manage and utilize leads dynamically.

### Configuring Your Outbound Calls

Configure your outbound calls with extensive customization options available through the API:

- **Define Call Logic**: Specify the conditions under which calls should be initiated, paused, or terminated based on real-time data.
- **Customize Voice and Language Settings**: Programmatically set voice attributes and language to align with the specific context or customer segment.
- **Schedule and Trigger Calls**: Schedule calls or trigger them instantly based on application logic or customer interactions.

### API Endpoints for Outbound Calls

Detailed documentation of API endpoints includes:

- **POST `/outbound/create`**: Endpoint to create a new outbound activity.
- **PUT `/outbound/update`**: Endpoint to update existing outbound settings.
- **DELETE `/outbound/{id}`**: Endpoint to delete an outbound activity.
