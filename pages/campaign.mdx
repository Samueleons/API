### What are Outbound Campaigns?

Outbound Campaigns enable your AI agents to make outgoing calls to a list of leads. These calls follow the conversational logic defined in your Pearl, ensuring consistent and effective communication with your potential clients.

### Steps to Create an Outbound Campaign

1. **Create a Pearl**: Ensure you have created a Pearl that defines the flow of the conversation for your outbound calls.

2. **Add Leads**: Add the leads you want to contact directly from the platform. You can input lead details such as name, phone number, and any other relevant information.

3. **Schedule Calls**: Define the schedule for when the AI agents will make the outbound calls. You can specify dates, times, and frequency to suit your campaign needs.

4. **Configure Call Settings**: Set up the call parameters, such as opening sentences, language preferences, and voice settings. These configurations ensure that the AI interacts as intended.

### Managing Your Outbound Campaigns

Once your campaign is set up, NLPearl.AI handles the outbound calls autonomously, following the Pearl flow you created. The platform allows you to monitor the progress and performance of your campaigns in real-time.

### Monitoring and Adjusting Your Outbound Campaigns

While you can receive detailed information about your outbound activities via our API, any modifications to the campaign setup or features such as voice changes and scheduling need to be handled directly on the platform.
